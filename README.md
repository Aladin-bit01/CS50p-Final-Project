## Real Little Professor:
As you can see in the previous image, this calculator, AKA Little Professor, is one of the coolest educational games that appeared during the late 20th century.
In fact, in 1976, The Little Professor was released by Texas Instruments and was sold for 20 $ a piece. One year later, already one million piece of this game 
had been sold.For more information about this educational tool, press on [Little Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Professor) .

## Code:
For this project, I recreated an online version of the Little Professor using the Pygame library. This library is installable using the following command on the terminal page of your IDE: `pip install pygame` .
